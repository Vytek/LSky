Notice: Because I do not earn money with this asset (it is more a need to finance my game), I have decided to create a new payment asset more advanced, this asset will now only receive updates that solutions bugs, etc. But will not have new features, sorry.

If you want to use this asset as a base, improve it and share it, you are free to do so as long as you respect the license.
